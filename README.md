### grep

Every programmer needs to know how to grep like a boss. Here's a classic grep:

`grep banana bread.txt`

–looks for all the locations of the string "banana" (if any) in the file bread.txt

Less typical:

`ls | grep bread`

–looks for all files in the current directory named or containing "bread" string.

And in a specific directory, looking for Python files only:

'ls /Users/garrygergrich | grep *.py'

-wonderful.



# vim

----------

    $ echo "# new python file" > snake.py
    $ vim snake.py


Press arrows to move, press `i` to enable insertion, to edit the file. Once you have made changes, press `esc` followed by `:` with `wq` then enter.

This will write (save) with `:w` and quit with `:q`
